        <h2>How to Compete</h2>
        <p>
          Most competitions are announced in our <a href="https://discord.gg/4Gwuqgr8G4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> 
          server before they go live. Make sure notifications are on so you never miss a contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in-game, competition entry is usually free — just show up at the designated area or use 
          the competition command when the event opens. Some special events may require a small buy-in 
          of in-game currency, with the prize pool distributed to the top finishers.
        </p>
        <h2>Rankings &amp; Seasons</h2>
        <p>
          Competition results contribute to your overall season ranking. At the end of each season, the 
          top-ranked players receive <strong>exclusive season-end rewards</strong> not available anywhere else.
          Seasons typically run for several weeks — check Discord for current season info.
