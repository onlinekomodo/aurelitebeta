        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>
          Aurelite Mining was built for players who love the grind — the satisfying loop of digging deeper, 
          finding rarer ores, and converting your haul into server-wide wealth and reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our staff team keeps the server running smoothly, moderates fairly, and is always open to 
          player feedback. We believe a great server starts with a great community.
        </p>
